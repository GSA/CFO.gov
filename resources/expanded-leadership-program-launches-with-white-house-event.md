			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 6, 2015, the 2015-2016 CXO Fellows Program successfully launched with an event at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Fellows and their guests joined senior government officials to celebrate the accomplishments of the 2014-15 <abbr title="Chief Financial Officer">CFO</abbr> Council Fellows as their program year closes, and to kick off the 2015-16 program year for new class of CXO Fellows.</span></p>
<p>The 2015-16&nbsp;year’s CXO Fellows class represents an expansion of the well-regarded program to serve not only the federal financial management community, but the acquisitions and <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> sectors as well.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Reger, Deputy Controller of the United States of America, spoke to the crowd of Fellows about the call to public service and vital importance of career public servants. Reflecting on his own 37 years in public service, Mr. Reger noted the willingness to serve must be fostered and cultivated to help government run more efficiently and effectively. Mr. Reger’s remarks were followed by a speech by Rear Admiral Janice Hamby (USN, ret.) regarding the ongoing partnership of the National Defense University (NDU) and the Office of Executive Councils. NDU provides high-quality graduate level education to all those involved in the Fellows Program. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The graduating class of Chief Financial Officer Council Finance Fellows was recognized for their accomplishments over the past year by Mary Reding, Senior Advisor to the CFO Council. Ms. Reding welcomed those graduating to continue to interact with fellow alumni and connect to the new class of CXO Fellows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CXO Fellows Program is comprised of rising stars in the federal finance, acquisitions, and <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> sectors at the mid-career level who have shown leadership potential and acumen. Fellows are identified and nominated by their respective government agencies to participate in a year-long program consisting of graduate-level educational seminars at NDU in leadership development and cross-functional issues affecting the Federal Government . Fellows also attend Inside Government events and briefings by senior government officials, gaining a government-wide perspective on good governance, efficiency, and innovation. Fellows will also collaborate on a group project during the summer months to foster agency and sector communication and create lasting connections among the class.</span></p>
