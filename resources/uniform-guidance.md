In December 2014, <abbr title="Office of Management and Budget">OMB</abbr> together with Federal awarding agencies issued an interim final rule to implement the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards ([Uniform Guidance](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/12/19/2014-28697/federal-awarding-agency-regulatory-implementation-of-office-of-management-and-budgets-uniform)). This guidance and implementing regulations delivers on President Obama's second term management agenda and his first term directives under [Executive Order 13520](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-200900942/pdf/DCPD-200900942.pdf), the [February 28, 2011 Presidential Memorandum](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-201100123/pdf/DCPD-201100123.pdf), and the objectives laid out in [OMB Memorandum M-13-17](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-17.pdf) to better target financial risks and better direct resources to achieve evidence-based outcomes. The final guidance, originally published December 26, 2013 ([available at 78 FR 78589](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/FR-2013-12-26/2013-30465)) simultaneously improves performance, transparency, and oversight for Federal awards. The <abbr title="Council on Financial Assistance Reform">COFAR</abbr> will measure the impact of this guidance as described under [M-14-17](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2014/m-14-17.pdf).
