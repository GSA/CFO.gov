---
 Jennifer Funk is the Department of Transportation’s Deputy Chief Financial Officer. She is responsible for developing financial policy, overseeing the Annual Financial Statement Audit and Internal Control Program, and managing the financial systems and reporting for the Department. Since joining the Office of the Chief Financial Officer in 2005, she has led the launch of many high-priority, complex programs and initiatives including Federal Spending Transparency, the Department-wide Internal Control Program, and most recently, completing a three-year phased approach to implementing the Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act being one of the first cabinet level agencies to submit data files prior to the reporting deadline. Ms. Funk is DOT’s Senior Accountable Official for the DATA Act who, on a quarterly basis, must provide reasonable assurance that the agency’s internal controls support reliability and validity of the financial and award data submitted to the Treasury for publication on USASpending.gov.
 Ms. Funk began her federal government career in 1990 as a cooperative education student at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center and her first position was an entry-level accountant. After graduating from Saint Leo University with a degree in Accounting, she held progressively responsible roles at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. In these positions, she provided advice, leadership, and policy direction in various financial accounting, audit, accountability, and reporting matters including the depreciation and capitalization valuation of assets and software. Ms. Funk is a graduate of the Federal Executive Institute’s Leadership in a Democratic Society program.
             
   Throughout her career, Ms. Funk has actively championed the creation of government-wide coalitions to tackle a number of seemingly intractable Government-wide issues. Most recently, she co-chairs the Award Committee for E-Government (ACE) with responsibility for strategic planning and functional governance of the Integrated Award Environment (IAE), a Presidential E-Government initiative managed by GSA, portfolio of systems. The ACE provides a disciplined process and approach to decisions, priorities, and community needs for the IAE systems; resolves conflicts in priorities from other elements of the governance process; and identifies policy or other considerations for OMB decision or actions.
