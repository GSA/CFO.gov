The latest module for the Grant Training 101 on Uniform Guidance Administrative Requirements is now available. This module provides an introduction to the general provisions, pre- and post-award administrative requirements outlined in Subparts A through D of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200) for federal awarding agencies and award recipients. The module includes examples of how federal awarding agencies apply these requirements into their day-to-day grants management practices and what is required by the award recipient during the period of performance.
