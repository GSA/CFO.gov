    <h1>Centralized Recruiting Pilot</h1>
    <p> The Centralized Recruiting Pilot aims to make the federal hiring process more efficient and competitive by creating a centralized pool of pre-screened, placement-ready accounting candidates from which the fed-wide financial management community can directly hire. </p>
    <p>The pilot was successfully tested for three government-wide accounting positions at the GS-07 - 13. The Working Group is currently documenting lessons learned to determine next steps for this initiative. </p>
