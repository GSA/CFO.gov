00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Congress has been making appropriations since the beginning of the Republic.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.700
In earlier times when the federal government was much smaller

00:06.700 --> 00:09.000
and federal programs were much simpler,

00:09.000 --> 00:12.500
very specific line-item appropriations were most common. 

00:12.500 --> 00:18.000
In recent decades, however, as the federal budget has grown in both size and complexity, 

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
a lump-sum approach has become with few exceptions the standard approach.
