00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
The Federal government began awarding grants before the United States Constitution was drafted.

00:04.800 --> 00:12.000
One of the first examples of grant making was outlined in the Articles of Confederation whereby Congress provided for land grants.

1860s. In the midst of the Civil War, President Lincoln signed the Morrill Act into law, establishing land-grant universities. 


00:20.000 --> 00:25.500
The U.S. Department of Agriculture was established, beginning formal programs of national agricultural research.

00:25.500 --> 00:31.000
Throughout our nation's history, the Federal government has continuously provided aid to States and local governments

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
to help address things like westward expansion, civil disturbances, natural disasters, and the need for internal improvements.


00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
The federal grant system that we have today began to take shape in the early 1900s.  

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
During this period, Theodore Roosevelt's administration promoted agriculture, 

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
education, professionalism, and science to further the development of land-grant universities and the USDA. 

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
Throughout the 1910s grant programs were created that included features similar to today's grants such as matching and eligibility requirements.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.200
By the end of 2010, enrollment at American colleges and universities had never been higher. 

01:07.200 --> 01:12.000
In 2009, there were 20.4 million students in degree-granting institutions.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.500
Grants are widely available to support scientific and technical research. 

01:15.500 --> 01:22.000
Most grants of this type are offered to educational institutions or to other large private or public research facilities.


01:22.000 --> 01:26.300
Grants have become an important form of funding for many organizations and individuals. 

01:26.300 --> 02:00.000
The money and other assistance provided by grants helps to drive the economy, encourage innovation, support communities and create jobs.
