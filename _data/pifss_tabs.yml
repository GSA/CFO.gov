                This session spoke about the "Red Flags of Infrastructure Fraud". The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides over $1.2 trillion in federal spending over the next five years mostly in grants and contracts to states and local governments for public transit, railways, power grids, electric vehicles and buses, ferries, airports, waterways, climate change, broadband internet, environmental protection, drinking water, and transformation safety. This program of fast-moving money, with untested controls, provides vast opportunities for fraud and waste. Auditors, investigators, and grants and contract managers at all levels of government will need to be especially vigilant for possible schemes and red flag indicators of fraud that robs the public of funds.
