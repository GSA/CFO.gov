    <p>The federal government obligates over one trillion dollars in Federal financial assistance funds annually that support thousands of critical programs that support our nation’s infrastructure, health, education, security, and more.  Improving the quality of program results and transparently communicating to the American public how taxpayer funds are spent to achieve our shared goals continues to be an important goal of the administration. Recent OMB guidance has built on recent progress in the important areas of Program Planning, Design, and Execution; Managing Risk in Program Design; Public Reporting of Financial and Award Data Post-Award Data and Reporting.  Improved program design and implementation of Federal financial assistance is critical to achieving successful program and financial results for the American people.</p>
