    <p>Effective stewardship of taxpayer funds is a critical responsibility of the Federal Government and the Chief Financial Officer has the responsibility for all financial management operations and activities in their agency.  Improper payments not only impact financial stability, but they are also harmful to the integrity and reputation of the Federal Government and degrade the publicâ€™s trust.   By making payment integrity a top priority, the CFO Council improves the prevention of improper payments and protects taxpayer money.</p>
