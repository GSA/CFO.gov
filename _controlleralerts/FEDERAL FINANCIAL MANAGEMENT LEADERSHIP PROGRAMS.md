*Controller Alerts are designed to bring your attention to emerging financial management issues that may require agency attention or action.  These Alerts are intended to make sure that the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) community is aware of key issues where the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) believes further action may be warranted, but do not constitute official guidance or include specific tasks for agencies beyond consideration of appropriate steps to address the issue.  Additional Controller Alerts can be viewed at [https://max.omb.gov/community/x/ihXjJg](https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.max.gov%2Flogin.action%3Fos_destination%3D%252Fpages%252Ftinyurl.action%253FurlIdentifier%253DihXjJg).*

This Controller Alert provides information on Office of Federal Financial Management Financial Management Leadership Program and the CFO Council Fellows.

Office of Federal Financial Management Financial Management Leadership Program

OFFM is pleased to announce the Financial Management Leadership Program. The year-long fellowship program (August-July) is designed to provide promising financial managers around the Federal government with the opportunity to spend a year working at the Office of Management and Budget leading government-wide initiatives and developing the skills necessary to become a true leader in financial management. The Leadership Program is open to all grade levels. Participants will chose one of five available tracks to specialize in, and will be responsible for leading a government-wide initiative on their chosen track during their year-long tenure. At the end of the year, successful participants will receive a certificate of completion and a letter of professional recommendation from the OMB Controller.

More information can be found in the attached brochure and note that applications for the 2014-2015 year are due to OFFM by July 15.

CFO Council Fellows

The Chief Financial Officers Council Finance Fellows program was founded during the 2014 fiscal year. The specialized program provides an opportunity for federal financial leaders to grow professionally through a unique set of educational seminars and events sponsored by the CFOC. During the year long program, Fellows have the opportunity to meet with leaders in the Federal financial community and will learn about innovative government operations through educational seminars and "Inside Government" events. The objective of the program is to provide a unique perspective on innovative missions led by federal agencies. The CFOC Fellowship program is dedicated to providing enriching professional development opportunities for the next generation of Federal financial management leaders.

Selected Fellows remain in their current position at their home agency. Fellows are invited to participate in two to three program events each month with a total time commitment of eight-ten hours per month. All Fellows are expected to participate in unique Program activities culminating in a government wide project.

CFOC Fellows are rising stars in grades 9-12 and are nominated by the OCFO. Nominations are due August 1st for a start date in September. Please complete the application form to nominate a member of your staff.
