                <p>The CXO (Chief Executive Officers) Fellows Program is a VIRTUAL professional development program that engages the next generation of federal leaders in <b>acquisition/procurement, financial management/budget, human capital, information technology, and data</b>. Throughout the year-long program, CXO Fellows have the opportunity to grow professionally and build a diverse network of rising leaders from across the Federal Government. </p>
                <p>CXO Fellows remain in their current positions at their home agency and come together about <b>three times a month</b> (on Fridays) as a cohort for <b>developmental sessions</b> in leadership, cross-functional and interagency collaboration, and career development. In these sessions, CXO Fellows <b>meet with leaders in the federal management community</b> and gain valuable insight into innovative initiatives and best practices.</p>
                <p>There is <b>no cost</b> to participate in the program. <b>Download the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/CXO_Digital_Brochure_April_2022_Final.pdf">CXO Fellows Digital Brochure</a></b> to learn more. Plus, share the brochure with your supervisor, colleagues, or anyone who may be interested in the program!</p>

During the first 6 months of the CXO Fellows Program, I have built a network of diverse, creative, and forward-thinking colleagues across government who offer advice, encouragement, and sharing of experiences.

I am so excited to be on this journey in service to our country.">
