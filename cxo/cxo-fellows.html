                    <p><strong>After 10 years of a successful leadership development program by many measures, the decision has been made to discontinue the CXO Fellows Program. Thank you to all who participated in and supported the program over the years. If you have any questions, you can contact the CXO Fellows mailbox: <a href="mailto:cxofellowship@gsa.gov">cxofellowship@gsa.gov</a>.</strong></p>
                    <p>The CXO (Chief Executive Officers) Fellows Program is a VIRTUAL professional development program that engages the next generation of federal leaders in acquisition/procurement, financial management/budget, human capital, information technology, and data. Throughout the year-long program, CXO Fellows have the opportunity to grow professionally and build a diverse network of rising leaders from across the Federal Government. </p>
