            <p>As a Federal Employee, figuring out what knowledge and experiences you should obtain in order to best advance your career can be a daunting experience. There aren't enough government-wide resources available. Changing technology has also made the career planning process a rapidly shifting kaleidoscope of possibilities. Old roles are being automated and replaced. New jobs are coming into focus. We're all adjusting to this new vision of the future. It is a knowledge economy where those with needed skills and knowledge flourish. The CFO Council wants to empower the Federal Financial Management workforce. Our hope is that this tool will make it a little bit easier for you to plan your career and acquire needed knowledge and skills.</p>

            <p>Because this tool is a proof of concept, its features are very simple and it focuses only on the most common job series across the Financial Management community. If the tool succeeds (by demonstrating enough community interest) we'll be able to draw on additional support from the Administration to expand this tool to cover a wider range of jobs (including other functional areas outside FM), invest in a better user experience, and add in lots of other features and capabilities.</p>
            <p>By merely participating in this pilot effort, and using the tool, you can be part of the solution. If you think this type of resource is needed and helpful, and want to see more services like this, demonstrate your support for this initiative by using the tool, applying some of your annual training budget towards purchasing courses from partner vendors, spreading the word about this tool with your coworkers and management, and providing feedback on how we can expand and improve it.</p>
            <p>This pilot effort build on a unique public/private legal framework that allows this particular effort to be very nimble. We believe it highlights a better way for us to keep pace with the changing knowledge landscape. </p>
            <p>If you've got ideas on how it can be improved or how we can do a better job of getting the word out - please send your ideas here: <a href="mailto:CareerPlanningTrainingTool@gsa.gov">CareerPlanningTrainingTool@gsa.gov</a>.</p>

            <p>The purpose of the tool is to provide basic career guidance and point you to effective training. As a limited proof of concept, the tool is only focused on the four most common job series in the financial management community. You can start using the tool by "Clicking" on the Job Series and GS Level filters. Career guidance in the form of virtual "cards" will display in the center of the screen. Each card focuses on a specifically relevant "competency" and it includes information about the competency, relevant behaviors and proficiency levels. These cards reflect the CFO Council's consensus on what knowledge and skills are needed to succeed. The cards will also contain embedded pointers to vendor courses, available for purchase via pcard under $10K in price, that will help you master aspects of each competency.  Our partner vendors offer a wide array of course types and learning modalities. They include college course, micro-learning, cohort style, and many more options.</p>
            <p>Overall there are 54 competencies (cards) that may be applicable to each job series. What is shown on the cards "adjusts" to reflect the various GS levels. Note - you can further use the filters to narrow down which cards/competencies are displayed by selecting Job specific and general competencies. </p>

            <p>The initial tool is modest in scope and budget. We're attempting to demonstrate to Federal leadership that this type of offering is of interest to the community. It's been identified within the President's Management Agenda (PMA), and we're working with the PMA Team to grow this pilot. In the coming year, we hope to add in additional jobs relevant to the Federal Financial Assistance workforce, and the civilian DOD FM workforce. We also plan to refresh the competency cards. Those initiatives are all "in the works".</p>
            <p>If we're successful with driving traffic to the tool, and our vendors see patronage (the more purchases the see from us, the more willing they'll be to invest in expanding and improving their offerings), we'll be able to expand the tool to make it more polished / user friendly, increase its functionality, add in other careers/functional areas, build better linkages / direct tie-ins to annual career planning, evaluations, and hiring.</p>
