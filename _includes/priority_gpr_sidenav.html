        <h2>Goal Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The Payment Integrity Priority Area is focused on demonstrating stewardship of taxpayer dollars by reducing monetary loss and making payments correctly the first time.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        While improper payments may compromise citizens' trust in government, they are not always indicative of fraud, nor do they necessarily represent payments that should not have been made. Having the right information and the capacity to address root causes are critical components.

        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            The Payment Integrity Priority Area works to improve the efficiencies of government programs by focusing on getting government payments right the first time they are made and reducing the cost associated with an incorrect payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, this Priority Area builds trust in government by better understanding the nature of improper payments and their relationship to payment integrity.

        <img  alt="The Getting Payments Right Priority Area strategic approach features the following 5 strategies. These strategies build on one another. Strategy 1: Clarify and Streamline Requirements -- Reduce burden and improve compliance to allow program resources to focus on preventing improper payments that result in monetary loss. Strategy 2: Identify Monetary Loss Root Causes -- Identify points(s) in the payment process where improper payments occur that result in monetary loss. Strategy 3: Strategic Data Use -- Identify data sets/analysis techniques and link to root causes. Obtain needed data to improve capacity to prevent and detect improper payments. Strategy 4: Mitigation Strategies -- Identify non-data related mitigation strategies and best practices to preventing improper payments and share them across the government. Strategy 5: Strengthen Partnership States -- Identify opportunities to partner with States to improve improper payment detection and prevention capabilities in federally funded state-administered programs." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/gpr_strategy.png">
