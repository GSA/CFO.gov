        <p>"The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021" (Pub. L. No. 117-2) (ARP) provides funding for critical resources to strengthen the backbone of our country, while also responding to the public health and economic crisis the Nation faces as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP includes funding to set up community vaccination sites nationwide, scale up testing and tracing, eliminate supply shortage problems, invest in high-quality treatments, and address disparities in obtaining quality healthcare. The ARP also provides immediate relief to workers and families bearing the brunt of the public health and economic crisis and critical support to struggling communities and industries.</p>
