Most project managers and project team members use the desktop application, so that is the main focus of this course.

    "course_description": "This course is designed to provide you with DoD-specific authorities or prohibitions relating to fiscal law (also called “federal appropriations law”). DoD, like all federal agencies, is bound by the basic fiscal law rules. However, DoD has considerably more flexibility in many areas because Congress has given specific statutory authority to DoD. Additionally, DoD has several activities that make it different from other agencies (e.g., Military Construction). Basic federal appropriations law courses may not address these DoD-specific topics. This course covers the major fiscal law exceptions and authorities that apply to DoD.",
    "additional_course_information": "Who Should Attend?\n\nThis course is for DoD military members, civilian employees, and Defense contractors who have already taken a Federal Appropriations Law course and need to know more about DoD-specific authorities in fiscal law or need an update on the latest developments in fiscal law.",

Federal agencies endure times when funds are scarce, including: at year-end; during continuing resolutions; and, when programs, projects and activities run into technical, management or financial difficulties. How do we predict, prevent, prepare and decide during these tough times? What legal alternatives and actions are available offer the “best” outcomes? This course explores strategic approaches to federal financial management challenges; suggestions to prevent financial crises (including personal liability), and to mitigate impact of financial crises. Strategic alternatives and specific approaches are suggested through the financial cycle to the final disbursement of funds.",
