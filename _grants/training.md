**GRANTS TRAINING 101 MODULES**


Grants Training 101 Modules are available on this page. The training is designed to provide Federal officials a basic knowledge training on grants and cooperative agreements.  The training is not designed to provide detailed administrative, accounting and audit requirements that are specific to programs based on their statutory provisions, agency regulations and guidance.  Thus, this training should be supplemented by materials that are specific to agency guidance and requirements.
