    <h2>Mission History</h2>
    <div class="usa-content">
        The CFO Act of 1990 sought to improve Federal financial management practices by outlining standards of performance and transparency. The Act also assigned OMB greater responsibility for overseeing Federal financial management and it established the Chief Financial Officer's Council (CFOC) to directly advise and coordinate Financial Management activities of the agencies.
        <br>
        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <b>Option 1: </b>The CFO Council is a forum of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and Deputy CFOs of the largest Federal agencies, senior officials of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Department of the Treasury who work collaboratively to improve financial management across the U.S. Government.
        <br><br>
        <b>Option 2: </b>The CFOC is an organization of the CFOs and Deputy CFOs of the largest Federal agencies, senior officials of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of the Treasury who work collaboratively to improve financial management in the U.S. Government. The Council was established under the provisions of the CFO Act of 1990 to advise and coordinate the activities of the member agencies on such matters as consolidation and modernization of financial systems, improved quality of financial information, financial data and information standards, internal controls, legislation affecting financial operations and organizations, and any other financial management matter.
