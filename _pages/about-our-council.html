            “We, as members of the federal financial community, have the opportunity to not only understand what needs to be improved, but also to help change the federal government through innovation. There are so many exciting projects happening throughout the government to advance the work of financial offices, adapting our processes in a new and creative way. The CFO Council is committed to creating a collaborative environment to share best practices that improve financial systems, information, and standards, while modernizing our practices and advancing careers for our workforce. I encourage all of you to apply this age-old wisdom to both innovation and our personal career goals - ‘You will miss if you don’t take the shot - don’t be shy. At least try! We can’t do something if we don’t at least try.’”
