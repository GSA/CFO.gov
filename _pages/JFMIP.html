                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>The program was initiated in 1948 as a cooperative venture of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget (now the Director of Office of Management and Budget), and the Comptroller General of the United States. The program was given statutory authorization in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1950 (31 USC 65 as amended). In recognition of the importance of an adequate number of highly trained personnel, the then Chairman of the Civil Service Commission (now the Director of the Office of Personnel Management) was added.

            <p><b>For Distinguished Leadership in Financial Management Improvement</b></p>
            <p>Since 1971, the <abbr title="Joint Financial Management Improvement Program">JFMIP</abbr> Principals have sponsored an annual award program directed to excellence in financial
                management. The award was established to recognize senior financial management executives who, through
                outstanding and continuous leadership in financial management, have been principally responsible for
                significant economies, efficiencies, and improvements in the government. In 1981, the award was designated
                as the Donald L. Scantlebury Memorial Award in honor of the Chief Accountant of the <abbr title="Government Accountability Office">GAO</abbr> and the chairman of
                the <abbr title="Joint Financial Management Improvement Program">JFMIP</abbr> Steering Committee.
            </p>
            <p><b>Awards Presentation</b></p>
            <p>
                The <abbr title="Joint Financial Management Improvement Program">JFMIP</abbr> Principals will present the awards at the <abbr title="Joint Financial Management Improvement Program">JFMIP</abbr> Federal Financial Management Conference in
                Washington, DC on May 11, 2020.
            </p>
            <p><b>Eligibility</b></p>
            <p>
                All government employees who are senior executives and have demonstrated outstanding distinguished
                leadership resulting in effective financial management improvements over the years are eligible to be
                nominated. Nominees from small entities with fewer than 1,300 full-time employees will receive every
                consideration provided they meet the selection criteria. Previous nominees may be nominated provided they
                meet the other provisions of this announcement. The nomination should be updated to include the latest
                achievements of the nominee.
            </p>
            <p><b>Selection Criteria</b></p>
            <p>The Awards Committee will base its determinations on two factors: sustained leadership in financial
                management and specific accomplishments in financial management. For purposes of this award, the term
                financial management has been interpreted to include but is not limited to, the following areas: accounting,
                auditing, information technology, budgeting, asset management, control and allocation of resources, cost
                reduction, financial analysis, financial systems development, management analysis, planning, productivity
                measurement, and improvements, and financial and performance reporting.</p>
            <p><b>The Awards Committee will give substantial weight to sustained, high-quality leadership in financial
                management over the years considering:</b></p>

            <ol class="usa-list" type="1">
                <li>Long-term or lasting benefit of the nominee's accomplishments and/or exemplary leadership on the
                    efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of government operations.</li>
                <li>Measurable improvements in financial management technology or methodology resulting from the
                    nominee's accomplishments. </li>
                <li>Innovation of the nominee's accomplishments. </li>
                <li>The impact of the nominee's accomplishments on government financial management policies and
                    practices. </li>
                <li>The impact of the nominee's accomplishments on his or her agency's financial management as a result
                    of improving human capital management. </li>
                <li>The extent to which the improvements would have been impossible or significantly lessened without
                    the nominee's involvement. The Awards Committee will also consider a series of specific
                    accomplishments for which the nominee is primarily responsible and where the results can be measured
                    specifically in terms of improvement in service, substantial savings, or significant technological
                    progress adaptable to a wide range of government financial management operations.</li>
            </ol>
