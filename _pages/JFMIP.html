    <h2>THE 2019 DONALD L. SCANTLEBURY MEMORIAL AWARD</h2>
    <div >
        <div><b>For Distinguished Leadership in Financial Management Improvement</b></div>
        <div>Since 1971, the JFMIP Principals have sponsored an annual award program directed to excellence in financial
            management. The award was established to recognize senior financial management executives who, through
            outstanding and continuous leadership in financial management, have been principally responsible for
            significant economies, efficiencies, and improvements in the government. In 1981, the award was designated
            as the Donald L. Scantlebury Memorial Award in honor of the Chief Accountant of the GAO and the chairman of
            the JFMIP Steering Committee.
        </div><br>
        <div><b>Awards Presentation</b></div>
        <div>
            The JFMIP Principals will present the awards at the JFMIP Federal Financial Management Conference in
            Washington, DC on May 11, 2020.
        </div><br>
        <div><b>Eligibility</b></div>
        <div>
            All government employees who are senior executives and have demonstrated outstanding distinguished
            leadership resulting in effective financial management improvements over the years are eligible to be
            nominated. Nominees from small entities with fewer than 1,300 full-time employees will receive every
            consideration provided they meet the selection criteria. Previous nominees may be nominated provided they
            meet the other provisions of this announcement. The nomination should be updated to include the latest
            achievements of the nominee.
        </div><br>
        <div><b>Selection Criteria</b></div>
        <div>The Awards Committee will base its determinations on two factors: sustained leadership in financial
            management and specific accomplishments in financial management. For purposes of this award, the term
            financial management has been interpreted to include but is not limited to, the following areas: accounting,
            auditing, information technology, budgeting, asset management, control and allocation of resources, cost
            reduction, financial analysis, financial systems development, management analysis, planning, productivity
            measurement, and improvements, and financial and performance reporting.</div><br>
        <div><b>The Awards Committee will give substantial weight to sustained, high-quality leadership in financial
                management over the years considering:</b></div>
        <div>
            <ol class="usa-list" type="1">
                <li>Long-term or lasting benefit of the nominee's accomplishments and/or exemplary leadership on the
                    efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of government operations.</li>
                <li>Measurable improvements in financial management technology or methodology resulting from the
                    nominee's accomplishments. </li>
                <li>Innovation of the nominee's accomplishments. </li>
                <li>The impact of the nominee's accomplishments on government financial management policies and
                    practices. </li>
                <li>The impact of the nominee's accomplishments on his or her agency's financial management as a result
                    of improving human capital management. </li>
                <li>The extent to which the improvements would have been impossible or significantly lessened without
                    the nominee's involvement. The Awards Committee will also consider a series of specific
                    accomplishments for which the nominee is primarily responsible and where the results can be measured
                    specifically in terms of improvement in service, substantial savings, or significant technological
                    progress adaptable to a wide range of government financial management operations.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div><b>Nomination Procedures</b></div>
        <div>
            Each nomination must include a copy of the nomination form below, a short biographical sketch of the
            nominee, and a statement of justification for the award. Including the nomination form, the nomination
            package must not exceed five (5) pages. Submissions must be in English and must be received on or before
