                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>The Joint Financial Management and Improvement Program (JFMIP) is a cooperative venture between the Department of Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personal Management, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office. It was initiated in 1948 and was given statutory authorization in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1950 (31 USC 65 as amended).</p>

                            The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, established a cooperative undertaking which required the Department of Treasury, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) and the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) to work together to improve financial practices in the federal government. The organization was originally referred to as the Joint Program for Improving Accounting in the Federal Government. In 1959, it became the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP). In 1966, the Civil Service Division (now the Office of Personal Management) was added to the JFMIP organization to provide expertise in personnel matters. JFMIP has been and continues to be a program that promotes the development, modernization, and use of improved financial management practices across the federal government.</p>

            <h3>THE DONALD L. SCANTLEBURY MEMORIAL AWARD</h3>
                <h4>FOR DISTINGUISHED LEADERSHIP IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT</h4>
                <p>The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) of the federal government is a cooperative undertaking for the Department of the Treasury, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The JFMIP Principals are the Secretary of the Treasury; the Comptroller General of the United States; the OMB Director; and the Director of OPM. The JFMIP Principals work in cooperation with each other and with operating agencies to improve and coordinate financial management policies and practices throughout the government. </p>
                <p>Since 1971, the JFMIP Principals have sponsored an annual award program directed to excellence in financial management. The award was established to recognize senior financial management executives who, through outstanding and continuous leadership in financial management, have been principally responsible for significant economies, efficiencies and improvements in the government. In 1981, the award was designated as the Donald L. Scantlebury Memorial Award in honor of the Chief Accountant of the GAO and the chairman of the JFMIP Steering Committee.</p>
                <h4>AWARDS PRESENTATION</h4>
                <p>The JFMIP Principals will present the awards at the JFMIP Federal Financial Management Conference/Webinar Event.</p>
                <h4>ELIGIBILITY</h4>
                <p>All government employees who are senior executives and have demonstrated outstanding distinguished leadership resulting in effective financial management improvements over the years are eligible to be nominated. Nominees from small entities with fewer than 1,300 full-time employees will receive every consideration provided they meet the selection criteria. Previous nominees may be nominated provided they meet the other provisions of this announcement. The nomination should be updated to include the latest achievements of the nominee.</p>
                <h4>SELECTION CRITERIA</h4>
                <p>The Awards Committee will base its determinations on two factors: sustained leadership in financial management and specific accomplishments in financial management. For purposes of this award, the term financial management has been interpreted to include, but is not limited to, the following areas: accounting, auditing, information technology, budgeting, asset management, control and allocation of resources, cost reduction, financial analysis, financial systems development, management analysis, planning, productivity measurement and improvements, and financial and performance reporting. </p>
                <p>The Awards Committee will give substantial weight to sustained, high-quality leadership in financial management over the years considering:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Long-term or lasting benefit of the nominee’s accomplishments and/or exemplary leadership on the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of government operations.</li>
                    <li>Measurable improvements in financial management technology or methodology resulting from the nominee’s accomplishments. </li>
                    <li>Innovation of the nominee’s accomplishments. </li>
                    <li>The impact of the nominee’s accomplishments on government financial management policies and practices. </li>
                    <li>The impact of the nominee’s accomplishments on his or her agency’s financial management as a result of improving human capital management. </li>
                    <li>The extent to which the improvements would have been impossible or significantly lessened without the nominee’s involvement.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>The Awards Committee will also consider a series of specific accomplishments for which the nominee is primarily responsible and where the results can be measured specifically in terms of improvement in service, substantial savings, or significant technological progress adaptable to a wide range of government financial management operations.</p>
                <h4>NOMINATION PROCEDURES</h4>
                <p>Each nomination must include a copy of the nomination form below, a short biographical sketch of the nominee, and a statement of justification for the award. Including the nomination form, the nomination package must not exceed five (5) pages. Submissions must be in English and must be received on or before the closing date to be eligible for consideration. Any nominations received after the closing date will not be considered. For further information, contact Dean Carpenter, (202) 512-5188, or by email to <a href="mailto:ScantleburyAward@gao.gov">ScantleburyAward@gao.gov</a>. </p>
                <p>Agencies are encouraged to use incentive awards program channels for solicitation and selection of nominees. No more than three nominations should be submitted from the head of your agency.</p>
                <p>Closing date for nominations: September 1, 2022</p>
                <p>Email your nomination to <a href="mailto:ScantleburyAward@gao.gov">ScantleburyAward@gao.gov</a>. </p>
