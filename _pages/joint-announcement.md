                <p>The American Rescue Plan (ARP) provides an additional $1.9 trillion in pandemic response and relief funding. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) share a common goal of aggressive oversight of ARP funds on behalf of the American taxpayers. </p>
                <p>To that end, OMB and the PRAC have recently engaged in extensive coordination to strengthen oversight and promote transparency of pandemic spending. As the first public steps in this ongoing effort, the Administration issued guidance in M-20-21 on March 19. OMB and the PRAC have also issued today the first in a series of alerts to agencies to raise awareness on key issues related to waste, fraud, and abuse, which can be located at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/payment-integrity-alert-prac/">Joint OMB PRAC</a> and <a href="https://www.pandemicoversight.gov/">Pandemicoversight</a>.</p>
