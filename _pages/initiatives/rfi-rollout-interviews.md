            <p>One of the hoped for outcomes with the workforce modernization <i>press outreach effort</i> (described in the preceding step) is to <strong>obtain favorable press articles and/or interviews</strong>. </p>

<p>If we are successful in interesting the press in this initiative, we will <strong>make the Workforce Leads available for interviews</strong>. After the interviews take place, web links to the positive press and media interviews will be posted and available on the Workforce Modernization site hosted on cfo.gov (giving credibility to the initiative). </p>

<p>These same press/media links will also be included in the reach-out emails that we send to perspective vendors during the application phase. These emails will be intended to increase the odds of vendors becoming aware and interested in the initiative.</p>
