            <p>Using a cross-agency, multi-platform approach, our social media strategy amplifies the RFI launch to members of the CFO community, news outlets, potential vendors, and interested public.  </p>
          <h4 name="pgov">Performance.gov</h4>
          <p>To coincide with the RFI launch, the Performance.gov Team will release the following social media post on their Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, reaching the federal performance management community and stakeholders.</p>            
          <p class="text-italic">Tweet:ðŸš¨ Are you an online university or tech company education provider? ðŸš¨ The CFO Council is rolling out an innovative upskilling initiative for its 140,000-member workforce (a test case for the 2.1M workforce).

          <p>To coincide with the RFI launch, GSA's Office of Strategic Communications will release the following social media post to their Twitter, Linkedin, and Facebook accounts, reaching news outlets, other federal agencies, and the interested public.</p>
           <p class="text-italic"> Tweet: The CFO Council is rolling out an innovative upskilling initiative for its 140,000-member workforce (a test case for the 2.1M workforce).

         <h4 name="agency">Request to CFO Council to amplify social media posts</h4>
          <p>In order to maximize the reach of the RFI launch announcement, we ask that members of the CFO Council use their personal and agency social media accounts to help amplify our planned content. The CFOC support team will send two emails to CFOC members:
            <ol>
              <li> A "prep email" 1-week before the RFI launch to make members aware of the social media campaign and allow time to coordinate with their agency comms offices, public affairs, or other parties, and </li>
              <li> An "action email" the day the RFI is launched and the social media posts are live to request that members like, retweet, or share the live posts.</li>
                </ol>
          <p>Language for each email can be found below:

             <p class="text-italic">Good Afternoon CFOC Community,</p>
              <p class="text-italic">Thank you very much for your support! As discussed in the April CFOC Meeting, the Workforce Modernization Working Group is very close to launching the FEDS Career Planning and Training Tool (updated briefing deck for context attached as a reminder) and we really need your help amplifying our outreach on social media. Making sure the outside-the-beltway providers (e.g., innovative online universities, tech companies) are aware, and interested, is absolutely critical to our success. If successful, this initiative has the potential to radically transform and accelerate workforce modernization and leveling up opportunity for everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-italic">The FEDS Career Planning and Training Tool and associated RFI will go live in the next two weeks. In preparation for the launch, we have two asks:
                <ol>
                  <li class="text-italic">Contact your agency communications offices to ask them to like, retweet, or share posts from Performance.gov and GSA on their social media accouunt when they go live. There is often a review process for these request, so we ask that you start this process early to ensure timely social media amplification. </li>
                  <li class="text-italic">If you have personal social media accounts that you use for CFOC-related items, plan to like, retweet, share, or draft your own posts to help amplify the RFI realease.</li> 
</ol>
<p class="text-italic">Thank you very much for your support and help! </p>
