            <p class="margin-top-0" style="font-size:15px;">
            Thank you for your support. We’re now ready to launch the application phase of the CFOC’s Workforce Modernization pilot. This is an initiative that will hopefully begin to serve the needs of our 140k workforce (with an estimated aggregate $140M training spend). If successful, the approach is cheap, easily scalable to most other areas of the government, creates an agile private/public partnership, and establishes an innovative competitive training marketplace (relatively free of much of the procurement/contracting requirements which typically impede governmental agility). 
 </p>
          <p style="font-size:15px;">In order for this pilot to succeed we need the top tier professional education providers to take notice and consider participating. Your help in reaching out to them would be most appreciated. <strong>Can you help amplify our press message/outreach or help us set up introductory meetings?</strong> Shown below is a high level representation of our outreach plan. 
          <p style="font-size:15px;">Click on any of the listed items below for more information about the comms process. If you’re looking for general information about the program, that can be found <a href="../assets/files/About-the-Career-Planning-and-Training-Tool-Initiative.pdf">here</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re very open to other ideas you might have on drawing positive attention. We see this experimental initiative as very relevant to the Administration’s goals - and as a way to significantly increase both opportunity and performance across the government. </p>    
   <a name="publish"></a><h2>Step 1) Publicize Vendor Application Process</h2>
    
<h3>RFI Application & Documents</h3>
        <div class="usa-graphic-list__row margin-bottom-1">
              <p>On Launch day of the Application Process, we’ll aim to do a number of things simultaneously. The main step being publishing of the RFI (Application Process) on sam.gov and also on cfo.gov. The RFI describes the career planning and training tool initiative and includes details on how education vendors can apply. In order to draw attention to this effort, we’ll also take a number of other steps that are described in the paragraphs below.</p>
          <p>Application documents include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="../assets/files/CFO-RFI-App-Package-Finalv1.pdf">RFI Application Guidance</a></li>

  <h3>CFO.gov Content Updates</h3>
        <div class="usa-graphic-list__row margin-bottom-1">
                   <p>Coincident with publishing the RFI we’ll also activate content on cfo.gov that describes the workforce modernization effort, the career planning tool, and the application process. Shown in the document below is a rough visualization of that content and how it will look. Note, the web content is currently in development and should be ready by May 13 to view as demonstration link.</p>

          <h3>Press Release</h3>
        <div class="usa-graphic-list__row margin-bottom-1">
            <p>A key part of our publicity and outreach strategy is news coverage of the Workforce Modernization Initiative and RFI process. In coordination with GSA's Office    of Strategic Communications (OSC), we will distribute a press release (linked below) to a targeted press list of national and industry outlets. Timed to coincide with the launch of the RFI, GSA OSC will leverage their press releationships to help source articles and interviews to amplify the RFI opportunity to potential vendors across the country.  </p>

<h3> Social Media Strategy</h3>
        <div class="usa-graphic-list__row margin-bottom-1">
            <p>Using a cross-agency, multi-platform approach, our social media strategy amplifies the RFI launch to members of the CFO community, news outlets, potential vendors, and interested public. Platforms include:
              <ul>
                <li>Performance.gov Twitter and LinkedIn</li>
                <li>GSA OSC Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook</li>

                      <p>In addition to the press release described and linked above, we are coordinating with GSA OSC to build a press outreach strategy to target national and industry news outlets for articles and interviews. GSA OSC will release the above press release the day the RFI is launched to the news outlets listed below:</p>

 <h3>Working Group Press Interviews</h3>
        <div class="usa-graphic-list__row margin-bottom-1">
       
            <p>One of the hoped for outcomes with the workforce modernization <i>press outreach effort</i> (described in the preceding step) is to <strong>obtain favorable press articles and/or interviews</strong>. </p>

<p>If we are successful in interesting the press in this initiative, we will <strong>make the Workforce Leads available for interviews</strong>. After the interviews take place, web links to the positive press and media interviews will be posted and available on the Workforce Modernization site hosted on cfo.gov (giving credibility to the initiative). </p>

<p>These same press/media links will also be included in the reach-out emails that we send to perspective vendors during the application phase. These emails will be intended to increase the odds of vendors becoming aware and interested in the initiative.</p>

<a name="step2"></a><h2>Step 3) Top Vendors Outreach Stimulate Interest</h2> 
  <a name="vendor"></a>
<h3 class="column-centered-heading margin-top-0 margin-bottom-1">Create Vendor Awareness</h3>
        <div class="usa-graphic-list__row margin-bottom-1">
            <p>The main aim of the entire communication/publicity effort (i.e., the press release, press outreach, interviews, etc.) is to <strong>draw the attention of innovative education providers</strong> who might not typically be active in the government space. We want them to be aware of this initiative and become interested enough that they apply.</p>

<p>Towards that end, we will <strong>directly reach-out</strong> to top-tier vendors. We’ll do this by <strong>networking, emails, and phone calls</strong>. In our email outreach, and in any 1-on-1 meetings, we’ll share the positive press references, the program brochure, links to the web pages, and other program collateral. Similar to prior steps, it is our hope that this will give heightened credibility to this effort and increase their willingness to apply.</p>
