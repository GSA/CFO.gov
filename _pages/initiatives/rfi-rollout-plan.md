            <p class="margin-top-0" style="font-size:15px;">
            Thank you for your support. Weâ€™re now ready to launch the application phase of the CFOCâ€™s Workforce Modernization pilot. This is an initiative that will hopefully begin to serve the needs of our 140k workforce (with an estimated aggregate $140M training spend). If successful, the approach is cheap, easily scalable to most other areas of the government, creates an agile private/public partnership, and establishes an innovative competitive training marketplace (relatively free of much of the procurement/contracting requirements which typically impede governmental agility). 
 </p>
          <p style="font-size:15px;">In order for this pilot to succeed we need the top tier professional education providers to take notice and consider participating. <strong>Your help</strong> in reaching out to them would be most appreciated. <strong>Can you help amplify our press message/outreach or help us set up introductory meetings?</strong> Shown below is a high level representation of our outreach plan. 
          <p style="font-size:15px;">Click on any of the listed items below for more information about the comms process. If youâ€™re looking for general information about the program, that can be found <a href="../assets/files/About-the-Career-Planning-and-Training-Tool-Initiative.pdf">here</a>.</p>

              <p>Weâ€™re very open to other ideas you might have on drawing positive attention. We see this experimental initiative as very relevant to the Administrationâ€™s goals - and as a way to significantly increase both opportunity and performance across the government. </p>

        <div class="usa-graphic-list__row margin-bottom-1">
              <p>On Launch day of the Application Process, weâ€™ll aim to do a number of things simultaneously. The main step being publishing of the RFI (Application Process) on sam.gov and also on cfo.gov. The RFI describes the career planning and training tool initiative and includes details on how education vendors can apply. In order to draw attention to this effort, weâ€™ll also take a number of other steps that are described in the paragraphs below.</p>
          <p>Application documents include:</p>
          <ul>

As discussed in the April CFOC Meeting, the Workforce Modernization Working Group is very close to launching the FEDS Career Planning and Training Tool (updated briefing deck for context attached as a reminder) and we really need your help amplifying our outreach on social media. Making sure the outside-the-beltway providers (e.g., innovative online universities, tech companies) are aware, and interested, is absolutely critical to our success. If successful, this initiative has the potential to radically transform and accelerate workforce modernization and leveling up opportunity for everyone.

                  <li class="text-italic">If you have personal social media accounts that you use for CFOC-related items, plan to like, retweet, share, or draft your own posts to help amplify the RFI realease.</li>

            <p>One of the hoped for outcomes with the workforce modernization <i>press outreach effort</i> (described in the preceding step) is to <strong>obtain favorable press articles and/or interviews</strong>. </p>

<p>If we are successful in interesting the press in this initiative, we will <strong>make the Workforce Leads available for interviews</strong>. After the interviews take place, web links to the positive press and media interviews will be posted and available on the Workforce Modernization site hosted on cfo.gov (giving credibility to the initiative). </p>

<p>These same press/media links will also be included in the reach-out emails that we send to perspective vendors during the application phase. These emails will be intended to increase the odds of vendors becoming aware and interested in the initiative.</p>

            <p>The main aim of the entire communication/publicity effort (i.e., the press release, press outreach, interviews, etc.) is to <strong>draw the attention of innovative education providers</strong> who might not typically be active in the government space. We want them to be aware of this initiative and become interested enough that they apply.</p>

<p>Towards that end, we will <strong>directly reach-out</strong> to top-tier vendors. Weâ€™ll do this by <strong>networking, emails, and phone calls</strong>. In our email outreach, and in any 1-on-1 meetings, weâ€™ll share the positive press references, the program brochure, links to the web pages, and other program collateral. Similar to prior steps, it is our hope that this will give heightened credibility to this effort and increase their willingness to apply.</p>
