             Yay! We’re ready to launch the application phase of the CFOC’s Workforce Modernization pilot.
          </p>
          <p>This is an initiative that will begin to serve the needs of our 140k workforce with an estimated $140M training spend. If successful, the approach is easily scalable to ALL other areas of the government, creates an agile private/public partnership, and establishes an innovative competitive training marketplace (free of 90% of the government purchasing requirements). All of which will integrate seamlessly within our career planning portal. </p>
          <p>In order for this pilot to succeed we need the top tier professional education providers to take notice and consider participating. Your help in reaching out to them would be most appreciated. Can you help amplify our press message/outreach or help us set up introductory meetings? Shown below is a high level representation of our outreach plan. We’re very open to other ideas you might have on drawing positive attention. We see this experimental initiative as very relevant to the Administration’s goals - and as a way to significantly increase both opportunity and performance across the government.</p>
