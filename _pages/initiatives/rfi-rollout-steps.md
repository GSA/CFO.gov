            <h3 id="publish">Publish RFI & Application Documents</h3>
            <p>On Launch day of the Application Process, weâ€™ll aim to do a number of things simultaneously. The main step being publishing of the RFI (Application Process) on sam.gov and also on cfo.gov. The RFI describes the career planning and training tool initiative and includes details on how education vendors can apply. In order to draw attention to this effort, weâ€™ll also take a number of other steps that are described in the paragraphs below.</p>
          <p>Application documents include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="../assets/files/CFO-RFI-App-Package-Finalv1.pdf">RFI Application Guidance</a></li>
            <li>Mapping Matrix</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
            <h3 id="site">CFO.gov Site Update Content</h3>
            <p>Coincident with publishing the RFI weâ€™ll also activate content on cfo.gov that describes the workforce modernization effort, the career planning tool, and the application process. Shown in the document below is a rough visualization of that content and how it will look. Note, the web content is currently in development and should be ready by May 13 to view as demonstration link.</p>

           <h3 id="press">Press Release</h3>
            <p>A key part of our publicity and outreach strategy is news coverage of the Workforce Modernization Initiative and RFI process. In coordination with GSA's Office    of Strategic Communications (OSC), we will distribute a press release (linked below) to a targested press list of national and industry outlets. Timed to coincide with the launch of the RFI, GSA OSC will leverage their press releationships to help source articles and interviews to amplify the RFI opportunity to potential vendors across the country.  </p>

         <hr>
            <h3 name="social">Social Media</h3>
            <p>Using a cross-agency, multi-platform approach, our social media strategy amplifies the RFI launch to members of the CFO community, news outlets, potential vendors, and interested public.  </p>
          <h4 name="pgov">Performance.gov</h4>
          <p>To coincide with the RFI launch, the Performance.gov Team will release the following social media post on their Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, reaching the federal performance management community and stakeholders.</p>            
          <p class="text-italic">Tweet:ðŸš¨ Are you an online university or tech company education provider? ðŸš¨ The CFO Council is rolling out an innovative upskilling initiative for its 140,000-member workforce (a test case for the 2.1M workforce).

         <h4 name="agency">Request to CFO Council to amplify social media posts</h4>
          <p>In order to maximize the reach of the RFI launch announcement, we ask that members of the CFO Council use their personal and agency social media accouuns to help amplify our planned content. The CFOC support team will send two emails to CFOC members:
            <ol>
              <li> a prep email 1-week before the RFI launch to make members aware of the social media campaign and allow time to coordinate with their agency commms offices, public affairs, or other parties, and </li>
              <li> an action email the day the RFI is launched and the social media posts are live to request that members like, retweet, or share the live posts.</li>
                </ol>
          <p>Language for each email can be found below:
<strong>Prep Email Langauge:</strong>
             <p class="text-italic">Good Afternoon CFOC Community,</p>
              <p class="text-italic">Thank you very much for your support! As discussed in the April CFOC Meeting, the Workforce Modernization Working Group is very close to launching the FEDS Career Planning and Training Tool (updated briefing deck for context attached as a reminder) and we really need your help amplifying our outreach on social media. Making sure the outside-the-beltway providers (e.g., innovative online universities, tech companies) are aware, and interested, is absolutely critical to our success. If successful, this initiative has the potential to radically transform and accelerate workforce modernization and leveling up opportunity for everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-italic">The FEDS Career Planning and Training Tool and associated RFI with go live in the next two weeks. In preparation for the launch, we have two asks:
                <ol>
                  <li class="text-italic">Contact your agency communications offices to ask them to like, retweet, or share posts from Performance.gov and GSA on their social media accouunt when they go live. There is often a review process for these request, so we ask that you start this process early to ensure timely social media amplification. </li>
                  <li class="text-italic">If you have personal social media accounts that you use for CFOC-related items, plan to like, retweet, share, or draft your own posts to help amplify the RFI realease.</li> 
</ol>

            <h3 id="interviews">Workforce Modernization Working Group Interviews</h3>
            <p>One of the hoped for outcomes with the workforce modernization <i>press outreach effort</i> (described in the preceding step) is to <strong>obtain favorable press articles and/or interviews</strong>. </p>

<p>If we are successful in interesting the press in this initiative, we will <strong>make the Workforce Leads available for interviews</strong>. After the interviews take place, web links to the positive press and media interviews will be posted and available on the Workforce Modernization site hosted on cfo.gov (giving credibility to the initiative). </p>

<p>These same press/media links will also be included in the reach-out emails that we send to perspective vendors during the application phase. These emails will be intended to increase the odds of vendors becoming aware and interested in the initiative.</p>
         <hr>
         <a name="vendor"></a>
            <h3>Outreach to Top Vendors to Stimulate Awareness</h3>
            <p>The main aim of the entire communication/publicity effort (i.e., the press release, press outreach, interviews, etc.) is to <strong>draw the attention of innovative education providers</strong> who might not typically be active in the government space. We want them to be aware of this initiative and become interested enough that they apply.</p>

<p>Towards that end, we will <strong>directly reach-out</strong> to top-tier vendors. Weâ€™ll do this by <strong>networking, emails, and phone calls</strong>. In our email outreach, and in any 1-on-1 meetings, weâ€™ll share the positive press references, the program brochure, links to the web pages, and other program collateral. Similar to prior steps, it is our hope that this will give heightened credibility to this effort and increase their willingness to apply.</p>

            <h3>Communications Collateral</h3>
