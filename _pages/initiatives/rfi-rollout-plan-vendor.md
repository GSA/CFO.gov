            <p>The main aim of the entire communication/publicity effort (i.e., the press release, press outreach, interviews, etc.) is to <strong>draw the attention of innovative education providers</strong> who might not typically be active in the government space. We want them to be aware of this initiative and become interested enough that they apply.</p>

<p>Towards that end, we will <strong>directly reach-out</strong> to top-tier vendors. We’ll do this by <strong>networking, emails, and phone calls</strong>. In our email outreach, and in any 1-on-1 meetings, we’ll share the positive press references, the program brochure, links to the web pages, and other program collateral. Similar to prior steps, it is our hope that this will give heightened credibility to this effort and increase their willingness to apply.</p>
