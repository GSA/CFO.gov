      <h2 class="margin-top-0">Overview</h2>
      <p>In October 2020, the JFMIP began an initiative to determine if misrepresented identity is a significant root cause of improper payments. The initiative consists of two phases: <p>
      <ol class="margin-bottom-3">
        <li class="margin-bottom-3">Report key practices and other considerations in effective identity verification, and</li>
        <li class="margin-bottom-3">Gather empirical data, through piloting selected controls, on the ability of enhanced identity-verification controls to increase payment integrity and on the significance of misrepresented identity as a root cause of improper payments.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Phase 1 Results</h2>

      <p>The JFMIP concluded the first phase of this initiative in [April] 2022 with two published products - a report and a simulation tool.</p>
      <p>The report presents the JFMIP's analysis and distillation of an expert panel discussion on identity verification practices. It discusses key practices and potential actions program offices can use to enhance identity verification and potentially reduce improper payments based on concepts and ideas discussed by an expert panel. For example, experts emphasized the importance of identifying and analyzing risks and establishing risk tolerances before designing a system of identity-verification controls to respond to the risks.</p>

      <p>The expert panel discussed a number of actions to address implementation challenges that program offices may encounter when implementing identity-verification controls. For example, to address certain segments of the population, such as socioeconomically vulnerable individuals, that may face an increased burden when verifying their identities, experts suggested offering multiple channels for applicants to verify their identities, such as in person and remote.</p>

      <p>The report also includes considerations for a framework to broaden implementation of identity-verification controls throughout federal-government programs. For example, panelists noted benefits in establishing risk-based federal standards that support identity-verification standardization and consistency, which allows a program office to collect the minimal amount of identity evidence needed to address its assessed level of risk.</p>

      <p>The following list summarizes the identity-verification key practices in the report.</p>

            <h3>Centralized Management Entity Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Implement a federated identity credentialing and verification framework</li>
              <li>Implement risk-based standards that support consistency of identity-verification processes</li>
              <li>Further enable data sharing within the federal government and with states and the private sector</li>
              <li>Allow applicants to choose from qualified credential service providers</li>
              <li>Consider initial costs and long-term funding sources</li>
              <li>Establish a central repository to share schemes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Program Office Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Program Office Considerations</li>
              <li>Identify and analyze risks related to identity verification</li>
              <li>Establish risk tolerances for improper payments that misrepresented identity causes</li>
              <li>Consider suitability of a uniform or risk-based transaction management system</li>
              <li>Design system of controls to allow for scalability and adaptability</li>
              <li>Consider placement of identity-verification controls</li>
              <li>Consider how data sharing and data hubs can facilitate risk analysis and response</li>
              <li>Perform data analytics to estimate the significance of misrepresented identity on improper payments</li>
            </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://gaoinnovations.gov/id_verification">simulation tool</a> allows users to further explore the benefits and tradeoffs of incorporating identity-verification controls and processes. This tool allows users to define modify certain characteristics of a hypothetical program and uses hypothetical data to demonstrate the effects of the identity-verification controls on the proportion of improper and proper payments prevented, administrative costs, and the program's reputation.</p>
      
      <h2>Phase 2</h2>
      <p>The JFMIP began phase II of this initiative in [May] 2022. In this phase, the JFMIP selected [X program] to pilot selected identity-verification controls. The JFMIP will analyze the effect of these controls on improper payments and will post the results when available. </p>
