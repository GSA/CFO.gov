      <p>The federal government spends trillions of dollars each year addressing public needs. The funds are distributed through payments made directly and through partners at the state and local levels. Improper payments have been a long-standing challenge for the federal government, with annual estimates of improper payments sometimes reaching totals in the hundreds of billions of dollarsâ€”$281 billion for fiscal year 2021, about a $75 billion increase from fiscal year 2020.<p>
