<div class="scorecards">
<p>The government can achieve the greatest return on investment for the taxpayer by ensuring that improper payments are eliminated in the highest-risk programs, otherwise known as <b>high-priority programs</b>.</p>
<p>These programs are designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with criteria found in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/M-21-19.pdf" >OMB Guidance Circular A-123, Appendix C</a>. Programs designated as a high-priority program can change each year.</p>
<p>Agencies with high-priority programs have additional reporting requirements, such as the quarterly completion and submission of payment integrity scorecards.</p>
<p>Payment integrity scorecards describe root causes of improper payments and   planned mitigation actions as well as track the status of a programâ€™s improvement.</p>
<p>Payment integrity scorecards for current year high-priority programs will be displayed below as they become available. Payment integrity scorecards are published approximately two months after the close of each fiscal quarter. Information published in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 represents figures and actions from prior to the Administration change that occurred on January 20, 2025.</p>
