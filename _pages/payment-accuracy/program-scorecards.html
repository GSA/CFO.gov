<div class="scorecards">
<p>The government can achieve the greatest return on investment for the taxpayer by ensuring that improper payments are eliminated in the highest-risk programs, otherwise known as <b>high-priority programs</b>.</p>
<p>These programs are designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with criteria found in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/M-21-19.pdf" >OMB Guidance Circular A-123, Appendix C</a>. Programs designated as a high-priority program can change each year.</p>
<p>Agencies with high-priority programs have additional reporting requirements, such as the quarterly completion and submission of payment integrity scorecards.</p>
<p>Payment integrity scorecards describe root causes of improper payments and   planned mitigation actions as well as track the status of a program’s improvement.</p>
<p>Payment integrity scorecards for current year high-priority programs will be displayed below as they become available. Payment integrity scorecards are published approximately two months after the close of each fiscal quarter.  Select a quarterly payment integrity scorecard for a specific program to view details. Program scorecards for the prior fiscal year’s high-priority programs  are also displayed below.</p>
