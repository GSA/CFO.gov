                <!-- <h4>Why is resolving the problem of Improper Payments important?</h4>
                <div>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, the American citizens deserve to know that their hard
                            earned tax dollars are being spent as efficiently and effectively as possible by the Federal
                            government.&nbsp; Although not all improper payments are fraud, and not all improper
                            payments represent a loss to the government, all improper payments degrade the integrity of
                            government programs and compromise citizens' trust in government.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
                            agencies have identified the programs that are susceptible to significant improper payments,
                            and measured, or are putting in place measurement plans, to determine the estimated amount
                            of improper payments. By identifying and measuring the problem, and determining the root
                            causes of error, the government is able to focus its resources so that corrective action
                            plans can be thoughtfully developed and successfully carried out.</span></p>
                </div> -->
                <!-- <h4>What causes Improper Payments?</h4>
                <div>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An improper payment can happen for a number of reasons. Knowing
                            the causes of the error is the essential first step in reducing or eliminating the improper
                            payment. By understanding the causes of improper payments, agencies can better implement
                            policies and procedures to reduce errors without negatively impacting the people who should
                            be receiving payments from the government.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><abbr title="Office of Management and Budget">OMB</abbr> developed improper payment categories to create a useful way
                            to break out causes for each agency. These categories are: </span></p>
                    <p><b>(1) Program Design or Structural Issue:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A situation in
                            which improper payments are the result of the design of the program or a structural issue.
                            For example, a scenario in which a program has a statutory (or regulatory) requirement to
                            pay benefits when due, regardless of whether or not all the information has been received to
                            confirm payment accuracy. </span></p>
                    <p><b>(2) Inability to Authenticate Eligibility:</b> <b>Inability to Access Data: </b><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;">A situation in which an improper payment is made because the
                            agency is unable to access data needed to authenticate an eligibility criteria. </span></p>
                    <p><b>(3) Inability to Authenticate Eligibility:</b> <b>Data Needed Does not Exist: </b><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;">A situation in which an improper payment is made because the
                            agency is unable to authenticate eligibility criteria because no database exists to check
                            against. </span></p>
                    <p><b>Failure to Verify Data:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A situation where the agency
                            (Federal, State, or local), or another party administering Federal dollars, fails to verify
                            appropriate data to determine whether or not a recipient should be receiving a payment, even
                            though such data exist in government or third-party databases. For reporting purposes, the
                            kind of data in question would include, but are not limited to, the following
                            sub-categories:&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><b>(4) Failure to Verify Death Data</b></p>
                    <p><b>(5) Failure to Verify Financial Data</b></p>
                    <p><b>(6) Failure to Verify Excluded Party Data</b></p>
                    <p><b>(7) Failure to Verify Prisoner Data</b></p>
                    <p><b>(8) Failure to Verify Other Eligibility Data</b></p>
                    <p><b>Administrative or Process Errors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Errors caused by
                            incorrect data entry, classifying, or processing of applications or payments. These types of
                            errors can be made by the following sub-categories:</span></p>
                    <p><b>(9) Federal Agency</b></p>
                    <p><b>(10) State or Local Agency</b></p>
                    <p><b>(11) Other Party</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -for example, a participating lender, or
                            any other type of organization </span></p>
                    <p><b>(12) Medical Necessity:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A situation in which a medical
                            provider delivers a service or item that does not meet coverage requirements for medical
                            necessity. </span></p>
                    <p><b>(13) Insufficient Documentation to Determine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A situation
                            where there is a lack of supporting documentation necessary to verify the accuracy of a
                            payment identified in the improper payment testing sample.</span></p>
                    <p class="p1"><b>(14) Other Reason:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If none of the above
                            categories apply, agencies may include any other reasons for the improper payment.</span>
                    </p>
                </div> -->
                <!-- <h4>Are all Improper Payments fraud?</h4>
                <div>
                    <p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. Contrary to common perception, not all improper
                            payments are fraud (i.e., an intentional misuse of funds). In fact, the vast majority of
                            improper payments are due to unintentional errors. For example, an error may occur because a
                            program does not have documentation to support a beneficiary's eligibility for a benefit, or
                            an eligible beneficiary receives a payment that is too high-or too low-due to a data entry
                            mistake.</span></p>
                </div> -->
                <!-- <h4>Do all Improper Payments Represent a Monetary Loss to the Government?</h4>
                <div>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. Another prevalent misunderstanding is that all improper
                            payments are a loss to the government, but that is not always the case. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, many of the overpayments are payments that may have been
                            proper, but were labeled improper due to a lack of documentation confirming payment
                            accuracy.</span></p>
                </div>
                <div> -->
                    <!-- <h4>How does a Federal agency measure its improper payments?</h4>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all Federal programs identified as susceptible to risk, the
                            responsible Federal agencies obtain a statistically valid estimate of the annual amount of
                            improper payments in those programs. </span><a

                <!-- <h4>What are Federal agencies doing to prevent and recover improper payments?</h4>
                <div>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to reducing instances of improper payments is to prevent
                            the improper payment before it occurs. To do this agencies must 1) properly identify the
                            root cause of the improper payment, 2) implement effective mitigation strategies to address
                            the root cause and 3) regularly assess their effectiveness, refining them as
                            necessary.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that supports this effort is the
                        </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/plaws/publ117/PLAW-116publ117.pdf"><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;"> Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) (P.L. 116-117) </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. PIIA
                            requires agencies to have a cost-effective program of internal control to prevent, detect,
                            and recover overpayments by implementing policies and directing activities that review and
                            verify payments before they go out the door.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agencies implement internal control programs to prevent and
                            detect improper payments. To address programs deemed susceptible to improper payments,
                            agencies develop and implement Corrective Action Plans (CAP's) used to set realistic targets
                            and outline a timetable to achieve scheduled targets. These CAPS can take many forms.
                            Agencies may identify a need to better train their own staff on how to administer a program
                            or realize that regulations or guidance to the public need to be revised to make
                            requirements more easily understood. CAPs are typically reviewed annually to ensure plans
                            focus on the root causes of the errors, thus making it more likely that targets are met. If
                            targets are not met, the agency may develop new strategies, adjust staffing and other
                            resources, and possibly revise targets.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some agencies also look to strengthen program integrity
                            throughout the organization, extending accountability to senior executives and program
                            officials. Beginning with senior leadership and cascading down, performance plans are tied
                            to agency strategic goals related to strengthening program integrity, protecting taxpayer
                            resources, and reducing improper payments. In some instances, senior executives and program
                            officials are evaluated as part of their semi-annual and annual performance evaluations on
                            their progress toward achieving these goals.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support agencies' efforts to reduce improper payments, the
                            Department of Treasury's Fiscal Service - the primary disburser of payments to individuals
                            and vendors on behalf of federal agencies - established the "Do Not Pay" portal to help
                            federal agencies reduce improper payments. The portal helps identify ineligible recipients
                            by verifying eligibility of a vendor, grantee, loan recipient, or beneficiary prior to
                            award; and re-verifying eligibility before, during, and after payments are made. The
                            Portal's mission is to protect the integrity of the government's payment process by
                            assisting agencies in mitigating and eliminating improper payments in a cost-effective
                            manner while safeguarding the privacy of individuals.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While recovering improper payment contract dollars is relatively
                            straightforward with a buyer-seller relationship, this is not true for all types of
                            payments. Federal payments are often made through "one-way" arrangements such as grants,
                            benefits, and loans. In these instances, the comparably low recovery rate inherent to the
                            payment type makes the use of payment recovery audits fail the cost-effectiveness test.
                            Pre-payment efforts to increase data verification and validation are more effective.
                            Research has shown that payment recovery audits are primarily effective for contract
                            payments.</span></p>

                <!-- <h4>Do Programs Administered by the States Make Improper Payments?</h4>
                <div>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. In general, state-administered programs are partially or
                            fully funded by the Federal Government, but each state sets its own guidelines regarding
                            eligibility and services. Just like Federally-administered programs, state-administered
                            programs also make improper payments.</span></p>

                            "Access measures" are developed by programs to assess items like the rate of participation
                            by eligible beneficiaries, rate of benefits claimed by eligible beneficiaries, availability
                            of program providers, whether eligible individuals are being improperly prevented from
                            accessing program benefits, the ease or difficulty of accessing benefits, or whether
