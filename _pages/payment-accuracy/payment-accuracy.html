            <p style="margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;">The government can achieve the greatest return on investment for the taxpayer by ensuring that improper payments are mitigated
                in the highest-risk programs, otherwise known as "high-priority programs." In pursuing reforms, the government must balance
                its responsibilities for reducing improper payments with the goal of providing effective payments to millions of
                beneficiaries and delivering results. These scorecards assist the public in understanding what agencies are doing to overcome unique challenges and obstacles to ensure federal funds reach the right recipient.</p>
