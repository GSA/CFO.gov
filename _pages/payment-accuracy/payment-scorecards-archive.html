<p>The government can achieve the greatest return on investment for the taxpayer by ensuring that improper payments are eliminated in the highest-risk programs, otherwise known as <strong>high-priority programs</strong>. These programs have estimates of improper payments resulting in monetary loss that exceed $100 million annually.</p>
<p>High-priority programs are designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies with high-priority programs have additional reporting requirements. Determination criteria and reporting requirements for high-priority programs are found in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/M-21-19.pdf" >OMB Guidance Circular A-123, Appendix C</a></p>
