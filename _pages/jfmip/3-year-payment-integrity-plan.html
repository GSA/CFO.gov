      <p class="margin-top-0 margin-bottom-0">Effective stewardship of taxpayer funds is a critical responsibility of the federal government. The federal government spends trillions of dollars each year addressing public needs, distributing the funds through payments made directly and through partners at the state and local levels. The increased flow of funds in response to the COVID-19 pandemic exposed existing vulnerabilities in federal and state government payment systems and processes that resulted in increased improper payments – including fraud – in federal programs.</p>
      <p>In Fiscal Year 2023, the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) began an initiative to take a “whole of government” approach to advancing the prevention and recovery of improper payments. This initiative aims to reinforce and amplify each JFMIP organizations’ respective efforts to promote payment integrity, build off past success, and apply lessons learned, especially from the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this initiative, JFMIP developed a 3-year plan to advance payment integrity that will evolve as the work progresses. This product, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/Final_JFMIP PI 3-YR Plan_01052024.pdf"><i>JFMIP’s Payment Integrity Initiative: A Three Year Plan to Advance Payment Integrity</i></a>, was issued in February 2024.</p>
