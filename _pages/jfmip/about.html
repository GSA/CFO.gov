It was initiated in 1948 and was given statutory authorization in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1950 (31 USC 65 as amended).</p>

        <p class="word-line">
            The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, established a cooperative undertaking which required the Department of Treasury, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) and the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) to work together to improve financial practices in the federal government. The organization was originally referred to as the Joint Program for Improving Accounting in the Federal Government. In 1959, it became the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP). In 1966, the Civil Service Division (now the Office of Personal Management) was added to the JFMIP organization to provide expertise in personnel matters. JFMIP has been and continues to be a program that promotes the development, modernization, and use of improved financial management practices across the federal government.
