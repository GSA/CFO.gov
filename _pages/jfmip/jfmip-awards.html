<h2 class="margin-bottom-neg-1 margin-top-neg-1">THE DONALD L. SCANTLEBURY MEMORIAL AWARD</h2>
<br />
<br />
<h3 class="margin-bottom-neg-1 margin-top-neg-1">FOR DISTINGUISHED LEADERSHIP IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT</h3>
<p class="word-line">The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) of the federal government is a cooperative undertaking for the Department of the Treasury, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The JFMIP Principals are the Secretary of the Treasury; the Comptroller General of the United States; the OMB Director; and the Director of OPM. The JFMIP Principals work in cooperation with each other and with operating agencies to improve and coordinate financial management policies and practices throughout the government. </p>
<p class="word-line">Since 1971, the JFMIP Principals have sponsored an annual award program directed to excellence in financial management. The award was established to recognize senior financial management executives who, through outstanding and continuous leadership in financial management, have been principally responsible for significant economies, efficiencies and improvements in the government. In 1981, the award was designated as the Donald L. Scantlebury Memorial Award in honor of the Chief Accountant of the GAO and the chairman of the JFMIP Steering Committee.</p>
<h3 class="margin-bottom-neg-1 margin-top-neg-1">AWARDS PRESENTATION</h3>
<p class="word-line">The JFMIP Principals will present the awards at the JFMIP Federal Financial Management Conference/Webinar Event.</p>
<h3 class="margin-bottom-neg-1 margin-top-neg-1">ELIGIBILITY</h3>
<p class="word-line">All government employees who are senior executives and have demonstrated outstanding distinguished leadership resulting in effective financial management improvements over the years are eligible to be nominated. Nominees from small entities with fewer than 1,300 full-time employees will receive every consideration provided they meet the selection criteria. Previous nominees may be nominated provided they meet the other provisions of this announcement. The nomination should be updated to include the latest achievements of the nominee.</p>
<h3 class="margin-bottom-neg-1 margin-top-neg-1">SELECTION CRITERIA</h3>
<p class="word-line">The Awards Committee will base its determinations on two factors: sustained leadership in financial management and specific accomplishments in financial management. For purposes of this award, the term financial management has been interpreted to include, but is not limited to, the following areas: accounting, auditing, information technology, budgeting, asset management, control and allocation of resources, cost reduction, financial analysis, financial systems development, management analysis, planning, productivity measurement and improvements, and financial and performance reporting. </p>
<p class="word-line">The Awards Committee will give substantial weight to sustained, high-quality leadership in financial management over the years considering:</p>
<ol>
    <li class="word-line">Long-term or lasting benefit of the nominee's accomplishments and/or exemplary leadership on the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of government operations.</li>
    <li class="word-line">Measurable improvements in financial management technology or methodology resulting from the nominee's accomplishments. </li>
    <li class="word-line">Innovation of the nominee's accomplishments. </li>
    <li class="word-line">The impact of the nominee's accomplishments on government financial management policies and practices. </li>
    <li class="word-line">The impact of the nominee's accomplishments on his or her agency's financial management as a result of improving human capital management. </li>
    <li class="word-line">The extent to which the improvements would have been impossible or significantly lessened without the nominee's involvement.</li>

</ol>
<p class="word-line">The Awards Committee will also consider a series of specific accomplishments for which the nominee is primarily responsible and where the results can be measured specifically in terms of improvement in service, substantial savings, or significant technological progress adaptable to a wide range of government financial management operations.</p>
<h3 class="margin-bottom-neg-1 margin-top-neg-1">NOMINATION PROCEDURES</h3>
