      <img  alt="The Federal Real Property Council strategic approach features the following 3 strategies. These strategies build on one another. Strategy 1: Implement Capital and Strategic Planning: Develop a risk-based multi-year government-wide capital planning process to optimize the Real Property Portfolio, one that encompasses the full budget life-cycle, link  capital plans to the agencies’ strategic planning processes. Update National Strategy and related policies to address key management opportunities and challenges to ensure a comprehensive approach to continue moving towards the goal of optimizing the portfolio. Strategy 3: Analyze Root Causes of Challenges & Pursue Legislative Changes: Determine root causes of existing real property management challenges as identified by auditors and others to lead FRPC efforts and create a plan for legislative reform that supports executive branch efforts to efficiently manage real property assets for improved mission-support, stewardship, and public service. Include all proposals in the President’s infrastructure and reform plans, including the Federal Revolving Fund. "
