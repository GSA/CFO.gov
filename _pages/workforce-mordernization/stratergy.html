                <p>In 2019, the Workforce Modernization Working Group launched a collaborative, partnership across more than a dozen agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget to think beyond traditional planning methods and explore new ways to build a vision of the needs, composition, and skills of the future financial management workforce. In August of 2019, the steering committee initiated a strategic planning effort that has yielded a comprehensive plan for the CFOC to use as a roadmap for navigating an uncertain future.</p>
