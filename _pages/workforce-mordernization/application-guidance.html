        <p>As an extension of this broader workforce modernization effort, and in order to support the active lifelong learning that will be needed to succeed, the WG has recognized an urgent need for comprehensive employee career planning tools and a vast increase in access to training pathways for our employees. It is the CFO Council’s commitment to put in place a Version 1.0 career planning/training solution. This web page and resources below provide more details to vendors that may be interested in partnering in this initiative. </p>
     <p><em>This initiative is being taken on in close coordination with the White House Executive Office of the President and in coordination with other Executive Councils. It is anticipated that if this effort is highly successful, it may be expanded to serve broader segments of the 2.1 million federal workforce.</em></p>

        <p><strong>How the Career Planning and Training Tool Will Operate</strong><br />
            The envisioned tool will include two main features:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>FM career and training map:</strong> This feature will be an easy to navigate, highly detailed, career map for federal financial management (FM) employees hosted on CFO.gov. 
                <ol class="alpha">
                    <li>The career map will address the specific knowledge, skills, and experiences needed by federal FM employees within 54 competency areas and 3 General Schedule (GS) brackets (junior, mid, and senior-level employees).</li>
                    <li>Employees will be able to reference this career map for detailed and timely guidance in determining what competency capabilities they should have at their current level and those recommended for advancement.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Numerous embedded links to external trusted training/education provider content:
                    <ol class="alpha">
                        <li>The career map will integrate hundreds of links to specific external courses, or other training/educational content, provided by a limited number of external training providers. The external training content, of many different formats or modalities, will address specific employee career competency knowledge needs at different stages of career progression. Types of content sought may include:
                            <ol class="roman">
                                <li>Graduate or undergraduate equivalent training content related to our 15 FM functional areas</li>
                                <li>Content relevant for the ongoing education of Certified Public Accountants (or equivalent)</li>
                                <li>Other content relevant to emerging knowledge/technology areas (e.g., Data Sciences, Analytics, RPA) or general federal employee skills/knowledge areas</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Federal FM employees will be able to interact directly with the tool to procure courses and training content through and established procurement process. See the Application Package resource (also listed below) for more information. </p>
