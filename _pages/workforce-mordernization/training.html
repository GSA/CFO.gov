    <h1>Data Analytics Training</h1>
    <p>The Working Group is aware of an urgent need for data analytics training in the federal financial management workforce.The Working Group, in partnership with the <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/">Chief Data Officers Council</a>, is exploring different options to provide short term data analytics training to a pilot cohort of federal employees. The cohorts would test different curriculum approaches (university courses, micro-learning, etc.) to measure the impact of concentrated upskilling in a key functional need area.</p>
    <p>The Working Group is in the planning phase of the pilot initiative. Next steps include a research phase, stakeholder engagement, and outreach to the broader federal financial management community.</p>
