<p style="text-align:center;"><i>“We can’t become what we need to be by remaining what we are.”</i> – <b>Oprah Winfrey</b></p>

It goes without saying that the country has changed during COVID, and with phrases like “the new normal” being tossed around, the evolution is only beginning. One thing is certain: strong leadership in every function of Government will be critical to assure that the nation can thrive even as we move into uncharted territory.

That brings us to you. Yes, YOU! As a GS9-13 employee, you’ve already demonstrated your commitment as a federal employee. You have a fair understanding of how the Government operates and how to get the job done within your agency. Yet with all the changes happening in the world, you’re beginning to wonder if it’s time for you to make a change – a career move that makes a difference, perhaps into a higher leadership role.

The CXO Fellows Program was created for people like you.

The premise is simple:
- Bring together a group of rising leaders who work in IT, Data, Human Capital, Finance or Acquisition
- Host at least 2 sessions each month for one year
- Focus on professional development, networking, and career growth

While the premise is simple, the positive impact each cohort has on the Fellows is dramatic:

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>“I truly believe that all our agencies are better for us having participated because we're bringing new experience, leveraging skills, and learning about new systems and technology and shared services that can benefit the U.S. government and the American people.”</i>
<br>
- CXO Alumni Louisa Olsen – Inter-American Foundation 
</p>

The CXO Fellows Program offers new skill sets that enhance performance at your current job and provides development skills that can propel your career forward into new leadership roles. Topics covered are chosen to prepare rising leaders for new challenges in their professional life:

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>“I think that being part of the program made senior leadership seem much less intimidating.
My goals going forward are to utilize the lessons learned from the CXO Fellowship to harness my skills to refine my skills as a leader.”</i>
<br>
– CXO Alumni Evan Butler-Sands – Department of Defense

Of course, it’s one thing to learn leadership skills and quite another to put them into action. After all, an effective leader needs to be a great motivator, and the ability to motivate others comes from having strong people skills. That’s why the CXO Fellows Program encourages interaction and networking among the Fellows. Interacting with Fellows from other agencies opens cross-collaboration that is rarely experienced in our often-siloed agencies and gives you the chance to hone your people skills, share problem-solving strategies, and build relationships. These are all pieces that you can leverage as you move onward and upward in your career:

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>“CXO has given me a path and the tools to say, hey, this is how you get there. So now I know how to get to where I want to go, and I have the tools to get there.” </i>

The CXO Fellows Program is a rare opportunity to invest in yourself, and all it will cost you is your time, focus, and commitment to grow. Applications for the next cohort are opening soon, so consider taking that next step to invest in yourself and join the next generation of rising leaders in the Federal Government.
