<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In accordance with the </span><a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-104/pdf/STATUTE-104-Pg2838.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFO Act of 1990</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the following information represents the financial management status report and a government-wide 5-year financial management plan. The report references the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial Management Progress and Priorities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section within the Financial Report of the U.S. Government. Additionally, the report highlights the most recent fiscal year&rsquo;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial reporting results</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, accountability means providing transparent information to the public about where and how federal dollars are being spent. It means protecting against fraud. It means avoiding wasteful or excessive use of taxpayer funds. It means ensuring that the federal government is not only responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars, but frugal stewards as well, looking for every opportunity to save money and create greater efficiencies. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government has come a long way since the passage of the CFO Act in 1990. Today, the federal financial management community is focused on three important improvement initiatives:</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the quality, utility, and transparency of financial information;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting against waste, fraud, and abuse; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping agencies maximize the impact of their limited financial resources.</span></li>
</ul>
