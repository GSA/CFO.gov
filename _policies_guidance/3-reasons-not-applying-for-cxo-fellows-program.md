The CXO Fellows Program has announced this year's Fellows. But wait, there must be some mistake! Why isn't your name on the list?

It's understandable to be disappointed. The CXO is a valuable program for professional growth, and there are many applicants every year. As much as we'd like to allow everyone who applies to join the program, we are limited to 100 Fellows each year. The selection process is a careful one, as Angela McPherson, CXO Fellows Program Director explained, "The final selections are made by the agency leadership. We try to have a diversified voice represented from each agency. So, we want to make sure that we have a person from each function under each agency. Because again, this is a cross functional collaboration, so we want to make sure that we're all learning how to speak the same language."

So, you've applied and weren't chosen. Now what? Does this mean that you can never apply again? Nothing could be further from the truth! We encourage those who are not picked to apply again. If you fulfill the basic requirements, there's no reason that you couldn't become part of the program in the future. If anything, your tenacity proves that you have what it takes to be a CXO Fellow.

As you no doubt know, the program is designed for rising leaders with a passion to learn and grow. You've already demonstrated that you have that passion by applying. As a person with leadership qualities, it's possible that you consider this a failure. Before you throw in the towel and insist that you'll never apply again, consider these "failures."

Thomas Edison famously said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that don't work." As a child he was told by his teachers that he would never succeed in life because "his mind wandered."

Oprah Winfrey, multimedia executive who has a net worth in the billions, was fired from her first TV news anchor job for being "too emotionally invested" in her reporting.

Elvis Presley was turned down by early managers and bands because "he couldn't sing."

Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team!

The world would've been a very different place if any of these icons had decided to give up at the first sign of "failure."

Whatever the reason, this year was not your year to be a Fellow. Next year could well be your year, but there is a 100% chance that it won't happen if you don't try.
