If you are interested in providing feedback on the <a href="https://fpi.omb.gov/explore-the-pilot-data/">FPI Pilot results</a> and process during the evaluation window, please share your feedback to <a href="mailto: fpi@omb.eop.gov">fpi@omb.eop.gov</a> before <b style="color: red">Friday, April 16th, 2021</b>.

We are particularly interested in feedback in the following areas:

- Do the results of pilot match your expectations of what a meaningful program should be?
- What are your thoughts on our methodology (the aggregation of program activities, program definition, - limiting scope to categories of interest etc.)?
- Do the results indicate that scaling of this approach would yield an inventory that would be useful for decision-making?
- What do you think the next steps should be?
- General Feedback
